### popular science

Starting in 2019, every summer, I organised a summer school at my former high school in Italy (Liceo Scientifico G. Marconi, in Pesaro). During my Ph.D. I participated in the “Science Goes to School” project in Dresden. The talk “Mixtures” was part of the Indiscienza 2025 festival at Collegio Ghislieri.

### the cacio e pepe saga

In 2025, together with a dreamtime of seven friends, I published a paper on the phase behaviour of the Cacio e Pepe pasta sauce together with seven Italian friends. Major international journals wrote about our publication, including The New York Times, BBC, The New Scientist, CNN, and The Guardian. We appeared on Noos, the popular science communication show by Alberto Angela.

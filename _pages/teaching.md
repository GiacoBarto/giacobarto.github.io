In 2017, I was the tutor of the course General Physics, held by Prof. Franco Dalfovo at the University of Trento. In the spring semester of 2020, I was the tutor of the Theoretical Biophysics course, held by Prof. Frank JÃ¼licher at the TU Dresden. In 2019 I co-supervised the master student Yash Rana during his internship at MPI PKS, together with Prof. Christoph Weber. Since 2022 and together with Prof. Christoph Weber, I have been co-supervising the PhD project ``Polymer sequence distributions with two information carriers in coexisting phases'' led by the PhD student Ivar Haugerud at the University of Augsburg

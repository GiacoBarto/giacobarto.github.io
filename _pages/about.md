I am interested in biophysics, jazz, and poetry, especially when mixed together.

I got my master degree in a joint programme between the University of Trento and SISSA in Trieste, and I have a Conservatorio diploma in Saxophone.  

I did my Ph.D. at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, working on Phase Separation with Christoph Weber and Frank JÃ¼licher.

I am currently doing a postdoc on active nematics with Jaume Casademunt at the University of Barcelona, supported by the Juan de la Cierva programme.
